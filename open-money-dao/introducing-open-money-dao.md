# Introducing Open Money DAO

## Mission

Make open money accessible to all

## Requirements

An open money system must be:

* Stable - relative to purchase power
* Nearly instant - transactions take seconds
* Nearly free - fees are insignificant, even for “micro-transactions”
* Private - balance and transaction history only revealed by user choice
* Simple - easy to use and understand
* Censorship resistant - no entity or government can seize or stop transactions
* Open - anyone can access with no documentation needed

## Goal

For an open money system to be successful and truly open, it must be built with the community it serves in an open and transparent fashion.

The Open Money DAO \(OMD\) begins as a community effort to share and surface knowledge in the problem-space, coordinate experimentation and product building, and combine resources to bring the tools to the world in a way that benefits the most number of people.

The Open Money DAO begins with this knowledge base, and we invite everyone interested in furthering the mission of open money to contribute to this knowledge base, thereby becoming a member of the DAO.

As the OMD community grows, an on-chain DAO structure will be formed to meet the goals of the DAO.

## Phases

1. Discover - user research and prototyping to discover high pain point problems
2. Build - create tools and infrastructure to solve user problems
3. Grow - implement growth tactics to acquire more users
4. Repeat - continue iterating on open money use cases until all have been addressed
5. Sustain - ensure the open money system is sustainable and incorruptible for generations
