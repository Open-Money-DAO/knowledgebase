**Inflation:** inflation of 53.8 recorded in 2019 - highest it has been in the past 3 decades - currency is volatile before or after political instability such as elections etc - suffering from high debt - monetary policies implemented in 2018 have not reduced inflation and have deepened the country's recession

**Capital Controls:** Residents are restricted to foreign exchange purchases of $10,000 a month, whereas non-residents are restricted to foreign exchange purchases of $1,000. Furthermore, exporters have between five to fifteen days to repatriate earnings and businesses require permission from the government to buy dollars or profits abroad. This is mainly due to Argentina's history of hyperinflation whereby Argentinians exchange their pesos for dollars when there is political/economical unrest
