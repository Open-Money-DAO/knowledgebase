**Inflation:** Hit a record of 53.8% in 2019, the highest it has been in the past three decades. Political instability such as elections contribute to currency volatility, as well as a high debt and insufficient monetary policies which have deepened the country's recession.

**Capital Controls:** Residents and non-residents are restricted to foreign exchange purchases of $10,000 and $1,000 a month respectively. Exporters have between five to fifteen days to repatriate earnings and businesses require permission from the government to buy dollars or bring in profits abroad.
