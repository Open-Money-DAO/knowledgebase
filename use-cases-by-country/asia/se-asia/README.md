South East Asia consists of multiple emerging market countries. While it may appear as a homogenous market at first glance, there are large cultural, language and legal differences between countries, and even within the countries that make the market highly fragmented. Typically there is no one size fits all product offering for this market, as the products must be localized by language, cultural messaging, legal status, and local business moats.

That being said, the region characterized by some similarities and problems that make open money systems more useful in these markets, including: capital controls, authoritarian governments, high degree of corruption, and lower GDP per capita.
