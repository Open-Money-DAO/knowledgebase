**Inflation -** Indonesia has not suffered from an inflation problem in recent years.  In 2019 there was an average of 3.5% of inflation. 

Main upward pressure came from prices of food, drinks and tobacco \(4.32 percent\), housing & utilities \(1.60 percent\) and personal care and other services \(4.71 percent\). Meanwhile, inflation came in at 0.05 percent for transport while cost dropped for information, communication and financial services \(-0.11 percent\)

**Capital Controls -** Transferring funds overseas requires reporting and must be approved by the Central Bank of Indonesia before the transaction goes through.

**Send -** It is relative easy to send monies to each other. The rise of e-wallets has given the rise to this ease domestically. People utilize a mix of remittance houses, e-money and even phone credits as money to transact with each other. However in regards of overseas cross border money sending there are still relative friction in achieving this due to the capital controls and licensing requirements.

**Spend -** Within tier 1 cities, especially so Jakarta, e-money and e-wallet payments are very popular for daily living, for example payments at restaurants and for transport.  However, outside of the capital, 80% of these transactions are still done in cash.

**Store -** Banking covers much of the tier 1 cities. People outside these cities generally store their monies in commodities, in cash at home or some and more popularly in gold denominated savings with cooperative financial institutions.

**Save -** Commercial banks generally offer savings rates denominated in the local currency IDR and provide a rate from 4%-8% for savings related products.

**Earn -** The digital economy is one of the biggest up and coming pillar of the Indonesian industry. Traditionally, Indonesia depends on commodity trades and raw material trading internationally.
